abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a genomic approach for the detection and quantitative analysis of messenger RNA molecules in a biological sample and is useful for studying cellular responses. RNA-seq has fueled much discovery and innovation in medicine over recent years. For practical reasons, the technique is usually conducted on samples comprising thousands to millions of cells. However, this has hindered direct assessment of the fundamental unit of biology-the cell. Since the first single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) study was published in 2009, many more have been conducted, mostly by specialist laboratories with unique skills in wet-lab single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and computation. However, with the increasing commercial availability of scRNA-seq platforms, and the rapid ongoing maturation of bioinformatics approaches, a point has been reached where any biomedical researcher or clinician can use scRNA-seq to make exciting discoveries. In this review, we present a practical guide to help researchers design their first scRNA-seq studies, including introductory information on experimental hardware, protocol choice, quality control, data analysis and biological interpretation.},

Next-generation sequencing technology allows for the rapid and accurate sequencing of many genes at once. This technology is becoming more common in oncology, though the clinical benefit of incorporating it into precision medicine strategies remains under significant debate. In this manuscript, we discuss the early findings of the impact of next-generation sequencing on cancer patient outcomes. We investigate why not all patients with genomic variants linked to a specific therapy receive that therapy and describe current barriers. Finally, we explore the current state of health insurance coverage for individual genome sequencing and targeted therapies for cancer. Based on our analysis, we recommend increased transparency around the determination of “actionable mutations” and a heightened focus on investigating the variations in health insurance coverage across patients receiving sequencing-matched therapies.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) has made great strides in sequencing technology as it enables sequencing of genes in a high throughput manner with low cost. Various NGS platforms such as Illumina, Roche, ABI/SOLiD are used for wet-lab analysis of NGS data and computational tools such as BWA, Bowtie, Galaxy, SanGeniX are used for dry-lab analysis of NGS data. One of the important aspects of NGS data is its usage in early disease diagnosis especially in cancer which was earlier not possible with conventional sequencing technologies such as Sanger sequencing, NGS can identify all those mutations which cannot be identified using conventional sequencing technologies as researchers can now sequence the whole genome, exome or transcriptome. Exome sequencing is preferred, as a higher number of mutations are found to exist in the exome part of genes. The present comprehensive review encompasses the complete NGS data analysis workflow that includes alignment of NGS reads, identification and annotation of mutations and visualization, discussion of software tools for variant identification and annotation, evaluation of structural variation in NGS data, and study of different DNA sequencing technologies. In the field of clinical oncology, NGS has already proven its usefulness, and the mortality rate has been reduced, as now doctors can suggest a proper treatment to their patients by checking the complete genomic profile. However, data storage and the complexity in interpreting enormous amounts of data obtained with NGS still remain a computational challenge to researchers, as for each sample, the number of different and very large analysis files are generated directly from the raw sequence read file to the final result file. NGS resultant data is very complex, and its interpretation requires expert bioinformatics assistance, as a large number of mutations are identified from samples, but to differentiate clinically significant mutations among them with appropriate use of validation methods is a challenging task. This review is intended to provide researchers with a complete overview of NGS along with knowledge of how the tools will be employed, and insight into identification and interpretation of cancer mutations for clinical diagnostics.},

abstract = {Function at the organ level manifests itself from a heterogeneous collection of cell types. Cellular heterogeneity emerges from developmental processes by which multipotent progenitor cells make fate decisions and transition to specific cell types through intermediate cell states. Although genetic experimental strategies such as lineage tracing have provided insights into cell lineages, recent developments in single-cell technologies have greatly increased our ability to interrogate distinct cell types, as well as transitional cell states in tissue systems. From single-cell data that describe these intermediate cell states, computational tools have been developed to reconstruct cell-state transition trajectories that model cell developmental processes. These algorithms, although powerful, are still in their infancy, and attention must be paid to their strengths and weaknesses when they are used. Here, we review some of these tools, also referred to as pseudotemporal ordering algorithms, and their associated assumptions and caveats. We hope to provide a rational and generalizable workflow for single-cell trajectory analysis that is intuitive for experimental biologists.},

abstract = {Traditional RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) allows the detection of gene expression variations between two or more cell populations through differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis. However, genes that contribute to cell-to-cell differences are not discoverable with RNA-seq because RNA-seq samples are obtained from a mixture of cells. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) allows the detection of gene expression in each cell. With scRNA-seq, highly variable gene (HVG) discovery allows the detection of genes that contribute strongly to cell-to-cell variation within a homogeneous cell population, such as a population of embryonic stem cells. This analysis is implemented in many software packages. In this study, we compare seven HVG methods from six software packages, including BASiCS, Brennecke, scLVM, scran, scVEGs and Seurat. Our results demonstrate that reproducibility in HVG analysis requires a larger sample size than DEG analysis. Discrepancies between methods and potential issues in these tools are discussed and recommendations are made.},

Here, we develop a strategy to “anchor” diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize in situ gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns.

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths, and GC content covering a 2 20 concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in RNA-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and RNA input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control RNAs to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to GC content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to RNA termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control RNAs, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in RNA-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of DNA Elements projects (ENCODE and modENCODE), we demonstrate that external RNA controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of RNA-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification. These quality metrics facilitate comparable analysis across different samples, protocols, and platforms.},

Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and generated a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental approaches, then used the strategy to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems.},

@article{Ashley2010,
abstract = {Background: The cost of genomic information has fallen steeply, but the clinical translation of genetic risk estimates remains unclear. We aimed to undertake an integrated analysis of a complete human genome in a clinical context. Methods: We assessed a patient with a family history of vascular disease and early sudden death. Clinical assessment included analysis of this patient's full genome sequence, risk prediction for coronary artery disease, screening for causes of sudden cardiac death, and genetic counselling. Genetic analysis included the development of novel methods for the integration of whole genome and clinical risk. Disease and risk analysis focused on prediction of genetic risk of variants associated with mendelian disease, recognised drug responses, and pathogenicity for novel variants. We queried disease-specific mutation databases and pharmacogenomics databases to identify genes and mutations with known associations with disease and drug response. We estimated post-test probabilities of disease by applying likelihood ratios derived from integration of multiple common variants to age-appropriate and sex-appropriate pre-test probabilities. We also accounted for gene-environment interactions and conditionally dependent risks. Findings: Analysis of 2{\textperiodcentered}6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms and 752 copy number variations showed increased genetic risk for myocardial infarction, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. We discovered rare variants in three genes that are clinically associated with sudden cardiac death-TMEM43, DSP, and MYBPC3. A variant in LPA was consistent with a family history of coronary artery disease. The patient had a heterozygous null mutation in CYP2C19 suggesting probable clopidogrel resistance, several variants associated with a positive response to lipid-lowering therapy, and variants in CYP4F2 and VKORC1 that suggest he might have a low initial dosing requirement for warfarin. Many variants of uncertain importance were reported. Interpretation: Although challenges remain, our results suggest that whole-genome sequencing can yield useful and clinically relevant information for individual patients.

abstract = {An unprecedented wealth of biological data has been generated by the human genome project and sequencing projects in other organisms. The huge demand for analysis and interpretation of these data is being managed by the evolving science of bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is defined as the application of tools of computation and analysis to the capture and interpretation of biological data. It is an interdisciplinary field, which harnesses computer science, mathematics, physics, and biology (fig 1). Bioinformatics is essential for management of data in modern biology and medicine. This paper describes the main tools of the bioinformatician and discusses how they are being used to interpret biological data and to further understanding of disease. The potential clinical applications of these data in drug discovery and development are also discussed.

#### Summary points

@article{Cui2007,
abstract = {Motivation: Life science researchers often require an exhaustive list of protein coding genes similar to a given query gene. To find such genes, homology search tools, such as BLAST or PatternHunter, return a set of high-scoring pairs (HSPs). These HSPs then need to be correlated with existing sequence annotations, or assembled manually into putative gene structures. This process is error-prone and labor-intensive, especially in genomes without reliable gene annotation. Results: We have developed a homology search solution that automates this process, and instead of HSPs returns complete gene structures. We achieve better sensitivity and specificity by adapting a hidden Markov model for gene finding to reflect features of the query gene. Compared to traditional homology search, our novel approach identifies splice sites much more reliably and can even locate exons that were lost in the query gene. On a testing set of 400 mouse query genes, we report 79% exon sensitivity and 80% exon specificity in the human genome based on orthologous genes annotated in NCBI HomoloGene. In the same set, we also found 50 (12%) gene structures with better protein alignment scores than the ones identified in HomoloGene. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author(s).},

These data may hold the promise of personalized medicine, leading to routinely available sequencing tests that can guide patient treatment decisions. In the era of high-throughput sequencing (HTS), computational considerations, data governance and clinical translation are the greatest rate-limiting steps. To ensure that the analysis, management and interpretation of such extensive omics data is exploited to its full potential, key factors, including sample sourcing, technology selection and computational expertise and resources, need to be considered, leading to an integrated set of high-performance tools and systems.

Single-cell trajectories can unveil how gene regulation governs cell fate decisions. However, learning the structure of complex trajectories with multiple branches remains a challenging computational problem. We present Monocle 2, an algorithm that uses reversed graph embedding to describe multiple fate decisions in a fully unsupervised manner. We applied Monocle 2 to two studies of blood development and found that mutations in the genes encoding key lineage transcription factors divert cells to alternative fates.},

Single-cell gene expression studies promise to reveal rare cell types and cryptic states, but the high variability of single-cell RNA-seq measurements frustrates efforts to assay transcriptional differences between cells. We introduce the Census algorithm to convert relative RNA-seq expression levels into relative transcript counts without the need for experimental spike-in controls. Analyzing changes in relative transcript counts led to dramatic improvements in accuracy compared to normalized read counts and enabled new statistical tests for identifying developmentally regulated genes. Census counts can be analyzed with widely used regression techniques to reveal changes in cell-fate-dependent gene expression, splicing patterns and allelic imbalances. We reanalyzed single-cell data from several developmental and disease studies, and demonstrate that Census enabled robust analysis at multiple layers of gene regulation. Census is freely available through our updated single-cell analysis toolkit, Monocle 2.},

@article{Trapnell2014,
abstract = {An algorithm uncovers transcriptome dynamics during differentiation by ordering RNA-Seq data from single cells. Defining the transcriptional dynamics of a temporal process such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells. Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers1. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

It is therefore of interest to have data containers that store the hierarchical structure together with the biological profile data, and provide functions to easily access or manipulate data at different resolutions. Here, we present TreeSummarizedExperiment, a R/S4 class that extends the commonly used SingleCellExperiment class by incorporating tree representations of rows and/or columns (represented by objects of the phylo class). It follows the convention of the SummarizedExperiment class, while providing links between the assays and the nodes of a tree to allow data manipulation at arbitrary levels of the tree. The package is designed to be extensible, allowing new functions on the tree (phylo) to be contributed. As the work is based on the SingleCellExperiment class and the phylo class, both of which are popular classes used in many R packages, it is expected to be able to interact seamlessly with many other tools.</p>},
